"For what is the Lattice Plot system optimized?","For high-density plots"
"What is the one critical difference between the lattice and the base graphic systems?","- Lattice graphic functions return a trellis object.whereas the basic system prints the plot directly on the graphics device
- The print methods for lattice actually plots the trellis object on the graphic device.
(on the command line, trellis objects are auto-printed)"
"Can you use functions of the base system to add text captions in lattice?","No, you cannot mix functions of different graphic systems"
"What are the four characteristics of the Lattice system?","- plots constructed by a single function call
- margins and spacing handled automatically
- ideal for creating conditioning plots (same plot under different conditions)
- panel functions allow to customy each panel"
"What is ggplot2?","- an implementation of the grammar of graphics (Wilkinson)
- Written by Hadley Wickham (Iowa State)
- 3rd graphics system"
"What does Leland Wilkinson say in Grammar of Graphics?","""Shorten the distance from mind to page"""
"What is a statistical graphic according to Leland Wilkinson?","""A mapping from data to aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars)"""
"What are the four characteristics of qplot()?","- analog to plot() with many built-in features
- Syntex between base and lattice
- nice, publication-ready graphics
- low customization of graphic aspects (go for ggplot2)"
"What are the basic components of a ggplot2 plot?","- data frame
- aesthetic mappings
- geoms
- facets
- stats
- scales
- coordinate system"
"How are ggplot2 plots built?","Ggplot2 plots are built in layers:
- plot the data
- overlay a summary
- metadata & annotation"
"How do you get a quick overview of your ggplot?","by saving it into a variable and calling summary() on it"
"Which are the 7 basic components of GGplot2?","- Data frame
- aesthetic mapping (how data are mapped)
- geoms (geometric objects)
- facets (ex. pannels)
- stats (e.g. quantiles)
- scale (coding used by aesthetic mapping)
- coordinate system"
