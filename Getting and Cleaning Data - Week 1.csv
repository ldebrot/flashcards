"How to describe raw data (as compared to processed data)?","- the original source of the data
- Often hard to use for data analyses
- Data analysis  includes  processing
- Raw data may only need to be processed once"
"How to describe processed data (as compared to raw data)?","- Data is ready for analysis
- Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming, etc.
- There may be standards for processing
- All steps should be recorded"
"What are the four components of tidy data?","1) the raw data
2) a tidy data set
3) a code book
4) explicit and exact description of steps followed"
"What are the four characteristics of raw data?","- No software run on the data
- non-manipulated
- non-removed
- non-summarized"
"How is tidy data presented?","- each variable in one column
- each observation in one row
- each kind of variable in one table
- if several tables, one index column
- top row include human readable variable names
- one file per table"
"What does the code book contain?","- information about the variables (including units!)
- information about the summary choices made
- information about the experimental study design used
- In a Text file
- Including a section called study design (how they were collected)
- One section called Code book describing each variable and its units"
"What does an instruction list include?","- A computer script (in R or Python)
- the input for the script is the raw data
- the output is the processed tidy data
- the recipe should do everything (no tweak neede)"
"How to check whether a directory exists?","file.exists(""directoryName"")

If (!file.exists(""data"")) dir.create(""data"")"
"How to download file on R?","download.file()

(always keep track of the date when the file was downloaded)"
"What are four important parameters of read.file / read.csv?","quote  : set whether there are any quoted values
 na.strings  : set the character representing a missing value
 nrows  : set the number of rows to read
 skip  : number of lines to skip before reading the file"
"How to read Excel filesÂ  in R?","use the xlsx package
-->e.g. read.xlsx (""filename"", sheetIndex=1, colIndex=2:3, rowIndex=1:4)"
"What is XML and for what is it used?","Extensible markup language (markup and content)

- used to store structured data
- widely used in Internet applications
- basis for most web scraping"
"How can you read XML files into R?","use the  XML package
 then use the  xmlTreeParse (fileUrl,useInternal=TRUE) function"
"How to extract the rootNode from an XML file?","xmlRoot() 

rootNode is a wrapper"
"How to extract the name from an XML file?","xmlName( rootNode )"
"How to access parts of an XML document?","use rootNode [[ number of element ]] 

e.g. rootNode[[1]]
or rootNode[[1]][[1]]"
"How to programatically extract parts of an XML file?","xmlSApply( rootNode , xmlValue )"
"What is the difference between XML and JSON and what do they have in common?","Common : similar structure
Different : syntax format"
"How to extract data from a JSON file?","Use the jsonlite package, then use
fromJSON(""url"")"
"What do you have when extracting data from a JSON file with fromJSON()?","A data.frame!

You can use the names() function to see the object names"
"How to turn a data set ino a JSON data set?","by using toJSON()"
"What are the advantages of data.table()?","- all functions of data.frame work on data.table
- Written C, so much faster (at subsetting, group and updating)
- You can use keys (useful for merging data)"
"What happens with DT[2] (if you don't specify row AND column?","It returns the second row (in the absence of row&column it uses the number as if it was the row)"
"How to select columns in a data.table?","e.g. for column 4:
 DT[,4, with = FALSE]"
