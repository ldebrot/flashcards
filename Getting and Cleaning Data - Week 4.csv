 - excluding character classes :  [^ a-z.?! ]
 - any character :  . 
- or :   | e.g. blabla   |blublu
- optional :  ()?
 - repetition any number of times (even 0) :  *
 - repetition at least one :  +  e.g.   [0-9]+ = at least one number"
"What is the difference between the following metacharacters?
^[Gg]ood |[Bb]ad
^([Gg]ood   |[Bb]ad )","^[Gg]ood |[Bb]ad --> onlw ""good"" at the beginning of a line
^([Gg]ood   |[Bb]ad ) --> both at the beginning of a line"
"What does this regular expression mean?
[Bb]ush( +[^ ]+ +){1,5} debate","Between B/bush and debate, a string occurs between 1 and 5 times.
the string means : at least one empty space, followed by at least one non-empty space, followed by at least one empty space (= a word)"

"In the dplyr package for what is summarize() most powerful?","Summarize() is most powerful when applied to grouped data"
"What is grouped data?","When you break up a dataset into groups of rows based on the values of one or more variables (normal funtion : group_by)"
"How to group a dataset by the values in a specific column?","By using  group_by( dataset ,  column )"
"What is ""chaining"" when dealing with grouped data via dplyr?","Chaining allows you to string together multiple function calls in a way that is compact and readable, while still accomplishing the desired result.

E.g. dataset %>% group_by(column) %>% summarize(newcol = mean(column)"
"Which package provides useful functions for tidying up data?","The tidyr package!"
"How to tidy a dataset where the header contains values (which the tidyr package)? E.g. two columns called ""male"" and ""female""","by using gather:
gather(dataset, key=newcolumn, value=count,-okaycolumn)
--> newcolumn will contain old variable names as values (e.g. ""male"" or ""female"")
--> value=count means it will count the values in the former male and female coluns
--> okaycolumn = is the one which is already tidy (not to be gathered)"
"When tidying data with tidyr, how to  separate one column into multiple columns?","By using the  separate()  function"
"How does the separate() function split up columns automatically?","Separate() splits on non-alphanumeric value (_ or - or : etc.)"
"With tidyr, how to turn values of a column into columns and filling them up with the value of another column?","spread(dataframe, key=coltospread, value=coltotakevalues)"
