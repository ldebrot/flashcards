It is used to determine appropriate sample sizes in experiments."
"When hypothesis testing, you have a  t statistic  of 2.5 in a t-distribution of 15 degrees of freedom. H_a says mu_a > mu_0. What is the probability of having a t-stat this big assuming H_0=T?","pt(q=2.5, df=15, lower.tail=FALSE)"
"What is p-value from the standpoint of an attained significance level?","The p-value is the smallest value of alpha at which you will reject the null hypothesis."
"Does sample size matter for sampling distributions of the mean to be normal ?","No, sample size does not matter.
 Sample observations have to be independent and je me from a nearly normal distribution."
"what are the two conditions for using the t-distribution for inference on a sample mean?","1) independence of observations
 2) observations come from a nearly normal distribution"
"When can you relax the conditions for using the t-distribution ?","The distribution might be moderately skewed (rather than totally normal) if the sample size exceeds 30."
"A point estimate is  unbiased  if...","...the sampling distribution is centeted around the parameter it estimates."
"When apply NON-normal point estimates?","- sample size too small
 - standard error estimate poor

(the effect of interest is first to be defined)"

H_A_ANOVA: at least one mean is different"
"What is called data snooping or data fishing?","When one does informal testing (by eye) and then decide which data to test formally."
"What is the Bonferroni correction?","The Bonferroni correction suggests that a more stringent significance level is more appropriate for multiple comparisons (instead of alpha: alpha/K, where K = k(k-1)/2)"
"Name three error rates","1) false positive (false results are called significant)
2) family wise error (at least one false positive)
3) false discovery rate (claims of significance are false)"
"How can you control the false positive rate?","Call all results with p-value under alpha significant."
"How can you control the family-wise error rate?","Process with all hypothesis tests with regular  p-value .
Then, divide  alpha  by the number nh of hypothesis tests performed and call all tests with  p-value   significant."
"How do you control false discovery rate (FDR)?","- calculate p-values normally
- order p-values from smallest to largest
- call  alpha * rank/m  (with rank = position in the order and m = number of tests)"
"Which are the two general options to control false positives?","1) adjust the alpha level
