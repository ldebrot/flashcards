"What's the difference between discrete and continuous random variables?","discrete = distinct or separate values
continuous = any value in an interval (even infinite)"
"Which function to use with discrete and continuous random values respectively?","Probability mass function = discrete
Probability density function = continuous"
"How to validate a probability density function?","The total value (surface of the distribution graph) has to be equal to one."
"What does the cumulatif distribution function provide?T","The probability of the value being less or equal to x (like cutting a slice in a function and calculate the size of the slice)"
"What does the survival function give?","It gives the probability of a value being above x."
