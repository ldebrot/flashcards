"What kind of Data science questions exist?","- Descriptive
- Exploratory
- Inferential
- Predictive
- Causal
- Mechanistic"
"What is the goal of descriptive data analyse?","Describe a data set (for example census data, no interpretation, no generalization or prediction)"
"What is the goal of exploratory analysis?","Find relationships you didn't know about

- discover new connections
- exploratory analysis are rarely the final say"
"Does correlation imply causation?","No, correlation does not imply causation!"
"What is the goal of inferential analysis?","Use a small sample of data to say something about a bigger data set

- Inference is commonly the goal of statistics
- Inference is about estimating the quantity
- Inference is also about estimating the uncertainty
- Inference depends heavily on the population and the sample scheme (group of people or objects)"
"What is the goal of predictive data analysis?","Use the data on one object to predict values of another object"
"On what does prediction depend heavily?","On measuring the right variables (vs. population/objects chosen)"
"What works best with prediction?","1) A simple model
2) A large data set"
"If x predicts y, does x cause y?","No."
"What is the goal of causal data analysis?","To know how the change of one variable impacts another variable."
"Do causual relationships every object or individual?","No, it only describes average effects."
"What kind of studies are required to identify causation?","Randomized studies"
"What is the goal of mechanistic analysis?","To understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in another variable."
"Where is mechanistic analysis used?","In physical or engineering science, one can use mechanistic analysis by a deterministic set of equations."
"What is the only random component in mechanistic data analysis?","Measurement error."
