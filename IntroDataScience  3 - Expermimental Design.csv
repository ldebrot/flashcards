"What are the four characteristics of a good experiment?","- have replication
- measure variability
- generalize the problem you care about
- are transparent"
"What is a confounder?","A variable that influences two variables but was invisible at first (literacy depends on feet size --> literacy and feet size both depend on age)"
"How to deal with confounders?","You can fix a variable, stratify it (given set of values like ""green, red, blue, etc.) or randomize it"
"What is sensitivity in prediction key quantities?","Probability that you have a positive test if you have a disease"
"What is specificity in predicting key quantities?","Probability that you have a negative test while actually having no disease)"
"What is the positive predictive value in predicting key quantities?","The probability of True positive (that you actually have a disease if you had a positive test)

negative predictive value --> how sure can you be about not having a disease if you had a negative test"
"What is accuracy in predicting key quantities?","Accuracy expresses the average probability of correct outcome (negative AND positive predictive value)"
"What is data dredging?","Use of data mining to uncover patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant, without first devising a specific hypothesis as to the underlying causality."
