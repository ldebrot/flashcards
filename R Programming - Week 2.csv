"How can one remove NA values from a column while using the mean function?","Use the na.rm argument!"
"In which order does argument matching work?","1st) exact match for named argument
2nd) partial match
3rd) positional match"
"What does lazy evaluation in functions mean?","It means that only the arguments actually used are evaluated by R.Â  The function works as long as there is no error. Ex:
f <- function(a, b) {
a^2
}"
"When is the ""..."" argument necessary in functions?","When the number of arguments passed to the function cannot be known in advance. 
E.g. mean(), paste(), etc.
Or when you extend the arguments of a function."
"When does partial matching of function arguments not apply?","Any arguments following the ""..."" argument must be named explicitly (= they cannot be matched partially)"
"How to list objects in your local workspace?","Use ls()"
"How to show current working directory in r?","getwd()"
"How to show files in a directory?","list.files() or dir()"
"How to set working directory?","Setwd()"
"How to create files and directories?","file.create() and dir.create()"
"How to check whether a file exists?","Use function file.exists()"
"How to get the size of a file?","file.info(""..."")$size"
"How to remove a directory?","Function unlink()"
"Why does the order of the packages in the search() list matter?","Because R searches for the values bound to a symbol (which might be a function) in the order of the search() list.
.globalenvironment = workspace is always first
package:base is always last"
"In what position is set a package in the search() list when loaded by the user?","In the 2nd position."
"Can there be a function and an object with the same name in the workspace environment?","No. But there can be an object and a function with the same name (symbol) if they are loaded in different workspaces (e.g. ""c"")"
"What scoping rules does R use?","- R uses lexical or static scoping (vs. dynamic scoping)"
"For what is lexical scoping useful?","For simplying statistical computations."
"What is a free variable?","It is a variable used in a function, but not defined in the header. (vs. formal argument)"
"What does Lexical scoping in R mean?","The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined."
"What is a function closure?","A function and an environment"
"Which environment has not any parent environment?","The empty environment."
"When does R tell you that it has not found a value for this symbol?","After searching through all environments, from the workspace down through the parent environments to the empty environment without finding a value bound to the symbol."
"When do R's scoping rules really matter?","When a function is defined within another function.
This means that free variables will be searched for in the environment in which the used function is defined."
"Can functions return functions?","Yes. (unlike in C)"
"Which languages support lexical scoping?","R
Scheme
Perl
Python
Common Lisp"
"Which are the two consequences of lexical scoping?","-All objects must be stored i memory
-All function must carry a pointer to their respective defining environments"
"Which are the basic coding standards?","- use text editor
- indent code
- Limit the width of your code
- Limit the length of your function (to one basic activity)"
"Which are the classes of  dates  and  times ?","Dates :  date  class
Times :  POSIXct  or   POSIXlt   classes"
"How are dates and times stored?","Dates : number of days since 1970/01/01
Times : number of seconds since 1970/01/01"
"How are times stored in POSIXct and POSIXlt classes?","POSIXct --> as a large integer
POSIXlt --> as a list (sec, min, hour, mday, mon, year, wday, yday, isdst)"
"Which function allows you to transform a character string into an actual time (POSIXlt class)?","strptime (datestring, ""%B...."")"
