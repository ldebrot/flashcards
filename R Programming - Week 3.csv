"What does  lapply  do?","It loops over a list and evaluates a function on each element."
"What does  sapply  do?","It loops over a list and evaluates a function on each element while trying to simplify the result:
- instead of systematically returning a list
- it returns a vector if every element is length 1
- it returns a matrix if every element is a vector of the same length (<1)"
"What does  apply  do?","It applies a function over the margins of an array.
For instance : collapse all rows in a column and return values per columns
OR collapse all columns in a row and return values per row"
"What does  tapply  do?","It applies a function over subsets of a vector."
"What does  mapply  do?",""
"What does the function  split()  do?","It splits objects into sub-pieces"
"How does one pass on arguments of a function used in lapply?","You add it as arguments of the lapply function:
lapply (x, FUN, arg1, arg2)"
"What happens to an object used in lapply when it's not a list?","It is coerced to a list.

What comes out of lapply is always a list!

However, the names are preserved."
"What is the apply() function equivalent to rowSums()?","apply(x, 1, sum)
1 = 1st dimension = rows
2 = 2nd dimension = columns"
"How can one collapse only the third dimension of an array when using  apply ?","apply(array, c(1,2), function)"
"When using rowMeans : How can you calculate the means of two dimensions of an array while collapsing the third?","rowMeans(a, dims =2)

Yes, you can use rowMeans for an array!"
"How do you define the subsets within a vector when using  tapply ?","By creating a factor or list of factors (same length as the vector).
E.g. the first half of values (subset A) has value 1, the second half value 2."
"Why is the split function so useful?","Because it splits objects into subpieces allowing you to use any type of function (lapply, sapply, etc.)"
"Do you need to you interaction() to combine two factors when using split?","No, that's the beauty of it:
split(x, list(f1, f2))"
"How to exclude empty levels created by split() with two factors?","add argument drop = TRUE
E.g. split(x, list(f1, f2), drop=TRUE)"
"Which are the 5 basic debugging tools in R?","- traceback : prints out the function call stack after an error
- debug : flags a function for debug mode (one line at a time)
- browser : suspends the execution of a function wherever it is called and puts it into debug mode
- trace : allow to insert debugging code into a function
- recover : allow to modify the error befavior in order to browse the function call stack"
"what is the difference between the browser and the debug function?","The debug function goes into browser mode right from the beginning of the function.
The browser function goes into browser mode only once it is calles (e.g. within a function)"
"How is recovery function handy?","It goes into browser mode as soon as an error comes up (rather than having the console printing an error message)"
"How can you create a vector of indices (factor) based on a logical expression?","which()
e.g. which(x>5) returns indices of the values in x higher than 5"
"What does any() and all() do?","the any() function will return true if any elements are true
all() returns true if all elements are true"
