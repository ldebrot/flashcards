"For what is the str() function used?","To see what is in an object (object type, data type, number of observations, etc.)"
"What is the variance?","variance  measures how far a set of numbers is spread out"
"Why would you want to generate the same random numbers and how?","By setting the seed : set.seed(anynumber)
--> choose the same number

Why? Because you might want to check your functions with the same set of random numbers."
"For what do r, d, p and q stand in stats functinos (rnorm, dnorm, etc.)","r = generate random numbers
d = calculate density
p = evaluate cumulative distribution
q = evaluates quantile distribution"
"What is profiling?","It is evaluating the speed of your code in a systematic way (how much time is needed to run through the code)"
"Why should you go for systematic profiling?","- useful to optimize your code
- better than guessing
- estimate the time needed for larger operations (code runs fine on one object, but what about 1000 objects?)"
"What does system.time() give you?","the user time (time used by CPUs)
the elapsed time (time experienced by the user of the programme)"
"How to start the R profiler?","Rprof()"
"How to show the data collected by the R profiler in a readable way?","summaryRprof()"
"Can Rprof and system.time be used simultaneously?","No. They don't like each other."
