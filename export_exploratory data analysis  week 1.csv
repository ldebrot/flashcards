"Principle of Analytic Graphics : what about evidence?","Evidence is always relative.

 --> show comparisons!"
"Which are the six principles of analytic graphics?","- show comparisons
 - show causlity (mechanism
  - show multivariate data (> 2 variables) 
  - integrate evidence 
  - describe evidence (tell a complete story) 
  - content is king (present depending on content) 
  (according to Edward Tufte)"
"5 good reasons to use graphs in data analysis?","- understand data properties
 - find patterns in data
 - suggest modeling strategies
 - debug analyses
 - communicate results"
"Give me 5 simple summaries of Data","- summary() 5-number summary
 - boxplot() boxplots
 - hist() histograms (+rug() )
 - density plot
 - bar plot"
"How to change the number of bars of a histogram?","By specifying break. E.g.
 hist(column, col = ""color"",  breaks =  100)"
"How to add a horizontal/vertical line in a plot?","abline(h  = height ) 
 --> specify v if to insert vertical line."
"How to change the display of the graphic?","Set or Query Graphical Parameters"
"Tell three 2-dimensional plots","- multiple 1-D plots (overlayed)
 - scatterplots
 - smooth scatterplots"
"Tell four multi-dimensional (more than 2D) plots","- multiple 2-D plots
 - add dimensions by adding color, size, shape
 - spinning plots
 - actual 3D plots (not that useful)"
"name three plotting systems in R","Three :
 - the base plotting system (add pieces one-by-one)
 - the Lattice system (one single function call)
 - the ggplot2 system (incremental but more default values)"
"what is the ""artist's palette"" model?","you add piece by piece to the model (base plot system)"
"which packages are in the core plotting, which ones are part of the lattice plotting system ?","base:  graphics  and  grDevices 
 lattice:  lattice  and  grid"
"How do you specify global graphics parameters?","with the par() function"
"How can you show the current graphics parameters?","by using  par( ""pch"" )"
"Name 7 base plot functions","- plot : make a scatterplot
- lines : add lines
- points : add points
- texte : add text labels
- title : add annotations
- mtext : add texte to the margins
- axis : add axis labels"
"How to copy a plot? into a pdf file?","dev.copy( png ,  file=""xxx.png"" ) 

 dev.copy2pdf(file="" xxx.pdf "") 

don't forget to close the device! (dev.off)"
"How to create a plot on a pdf?","- open graphics device  pdf(file = "" .... "") 
- close graphics device  dev.off()"
"Can you open several graphics devices?","Yes, and you can switch between gDev by using  dev.set()  and determine the currently open one by using  dev.cur()"
"What is the Simpson's paradoxe?","Simpson's paradox , or the  Yuleâ€“Simpson effect , is a paradox in probability and statistics,  in which a trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or  reverses when these groups are combined. 

It is sometimes given the  impersonal title  reversal paradox  or  amalgamation paradox."
"With which R command do you add a title to your plot (base plot sys)?","title(main=""blabla"")"
"Which R command to show the current plotting device?","dev.cur()"
"Which R command to show the range of values within a numeric vector?","range(vector)"
