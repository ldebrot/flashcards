"Three ways to define closeness of data points?","- euclidean distance (linear point-to-point)
- correlation similarity
- manhattan distance (binary)"
"For what is euclidean distance appropriate?","For high-dimensional distances (as you can add unlimited dimension in your calculation quite simply)"
"What is the input for hClustering?","the distance table calculated by the dist() function!"
"What is K-means clustering?","A partitioning approach for a fix number of clusters (the function regroups them into clusters)"
"What is SVD?","Singular Value Decomposition (for dimension reduction in matrices)"
"What is PCA","Principal Components Analysis"
"What kinds of linkage between clusters exist?","Extreme linkage : between most remote points 

Complete linkage : between the center of gravity of each cluster"
"What are the basic steps in producing a dendogram?","- matrix of coordinates (e.g. x and y coordinates for each point)
- produce matrix of distances with dist() function
- hierarchical cluster map by using hclust() function"
"What is a lower-rank matrix?","A matrix with fewer variables."
"What is PCA?","principle component analysis. It returns the right singular vector of the singular value decomposition (SVD) procedure"
"Can you run a SVD on a dataset containing missing values?","No, you cannot run a SVD on missing values."
"How to run a SVD on a dataset containing missing values?","use impute (bioconductor package)"
"How does scaling of a matrix work?","This means to subtract the column mean from every element and divide the result by the column standard deviation."
"Name a great package including improved color palettes!","grDevices  allows to use palettes of colors and color interpolation"
"Which function shows all available colors?","the  colors()  function - no argument required."
"Which are the 3 types of palettes?","-  sequential  : e.g. from low to high
-  diverging  : to show values diverging from another value
-  qualitative  : not ordered"
"Which package offers great palettes?","the  RColorBrewer  package!"
